# The Elevator Project

The main purpose of this program is to simulate an actual lift. The lift resides in a 10 storey apartment and requires a user panel which allows the users to select the floor they wish to go to. As the lift moves, the floor number will be displayed. When the floor is reached, appropriate sounds and messages will inform the user that the destination is reached. The user panel will also have door close and open buttons. If there is no activity after a while (5 seconds in the simulated scenario) the lift will go back to the first floor.
